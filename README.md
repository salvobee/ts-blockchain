# Typescript BlockChain System
Very simple blockchain system

## How to use it
Build an `index.js` file by launching
```
npm run build
```
Then you can execute the blockchain by running
```
npm run start
```
Alternatively you can directly execute the ts file directly using [deno](https://deno.land/)
